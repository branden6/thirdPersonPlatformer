This project is a 3D platformer game inspired by the classic Super Mario Bros. 
I am developing it as a personal practice project to enhance my skills in Unity, game development, and GitHub usage.  

The journey began on January 9th, 2025, and the goals are to: 
- Create a fun, interactive platformer while exploring new mechanics and improving my design workflow.
- Practice and improve game development skills.
- Learn and apply Unity features like character controllers, physics, and level design.
- Gain familiarity with version control using GitHub.

- Core Gameplay Mechanics:
  - Third-person character movement (running, jumping)
  - Basic platforming challenges  

- Future Additions:
  - Collectibles and scoring
  - Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
  - Improved visuals and sound effects
  - An attractive, functional UI that allows players to restart level, choose level
      - possibly switch characters?
